# Sign_language_detectionMODEL
# Sign Language Detection using AIML
# Overview
This project utilizes AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) along with Python libraries such as TensorFlow, MediaPipe, and OpenCV to detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time. The aim is to provide a system capable of understanding and translating sign language into text or spoken language, facilitating communication for the hearing impaired.

# Features
Real-time sign language gesture detection.
Utilizes TensorFlow for machine learning model implementation.
Integrates MediaPipe for hand detection and tracking.
Employs OpenCV for image processing and camera input handling.
Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (>=3.6)
TensorFlow
MediaPipe
OpenCV
You can install these dependencies using pip:

# bash code
pip install tensorflow mediapipe opencv-python

# Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-detection.git

# Navigate to the project directory:
bash code
cd sign-language-detection

# Run the main script:
bash code
python sign_language_detection.py

Point your camera towards a person making sign language gestures.

The program will detect and interpret the gestures in real-time.
